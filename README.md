## 💭 About
- 👋 Hi, I’m @petergeorgas
- 👀 I’m interested in offensive/defensive cyber, mobile development (iOS and Android), full-stack web development, cloud engineering, and back-end web services
   - For one reason or another, I am really enjoying writing code with Go right now, and have even [contributed to an open source project](https://github.com/keploy/samples-go) written completely in Go called [Keploy](https://github.com/keploy/keploy). 
- 🌱 Recently worked at Leidos as a Cyber Software Engineer Intern from June-December 2021

- 👋 Hi, I’m @petergeorgas
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, mobile development (iOS and Android), full-stack web development, and embedded systems
   - For one reason or another, I am really enjoying full-stack web development right now, and am self-studying React, Node.js, and some of the very many libraries that come along with them (Express, Redux, bcrypt, mongoose, and Next.js -- just to name a few).
- 🌱 Currently working at Leidos as a Cyber Software Engineer Intern from June-December 2021
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on anything! Feel free to reach out if you've got a cool project!
- 📫 Reach me by contacting my email: peter.georgas@utoledo.edu
